project data structure implemented

short explanation of the data structure

If your project is something I can run, please give instructions on how to do that

If your project isn't something that I can run, show me what it does. 

You can take a video and upload it to YouTube or Vimeo or simply to a private Google drive link. 
Or if video isn't your thing, a document with screenshots and words explaining what's going on.
